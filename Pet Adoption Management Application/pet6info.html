    <p>A Little Bit About Me:</p>
    <p>Bruno is a playful and strong Boxer with a lot of energy to burn. He loves playing fetch and enjoys running in open spaces. Bruno is loyal and affectionate and will bond deeply with his family. Heâ€™s great with kids and other pets, though he can sometimes get overly excited. Bruno would do best with an active family or individual who can provide him with plenty of exercise.</p>
